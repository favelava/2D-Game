# 2D-Game

This will eventually hold the source code for a 2D game. The game will be built in Unity.

All assets were made by me. There are only very basic test assets currently in the repository but that should change in the future. All assets current and future will be free to use. If you do use them in your game, let me know! I'd be very interested in playing with it.

A lot of credit goes to Brackeys on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys whose video tutorials on Unity form the basis of my scripts.
